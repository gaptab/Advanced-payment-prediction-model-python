**Generating Data**

The dataset includes financial and customer-related features such as:

âœ… Customer Age â€“ The age of the customer.

âœ… Income â€“ The annual income of the customer.

âœ… Property Value â€“ The value of the property being purchased.

âœ… Loan Amount & Loan Term â€“ The loan amount and its repayment duration (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years).

âœ… Interest Rate â€“ The interest rate applied to the loan.

âœ… Previous Advance Payments â€“ The number of past advance payments made.

âœ… Credit Score â€“ The customerâ€™s creditworthiness score.

âœ… Employment Status â€“ Whether the customer is employed, self-employed, or unemployed.

âœ… Advance Payment (Target Variable) â€“ Whether the customer makes an advance payment (Yes/No).

The target variable (Advance Payment) is binary â€“ 1 (Yes) or 0 (No), where 30% of customers in our dataset make advance payments.

**Data Preprocessing**

Splitting Features & Target Variable:

The independent variables (features) (like income, loan amount, etc.) are separated from the target variable (Advance Payment).

Handling Categorical Data:

"Employment Status" (Employed, Self-Employed, Unemployed) is converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding.

Train-Test Split:

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to train and evaluate the model.

Feature Scaling:

The numerical features are standardized to improve model performance. This ensures that all features are on the same scale, preventing bias in the predictions.

**Model Training & Prediction**

A Random Forest Classifier is used to train the model.

The model learns patterns from the customer data and predicts whether a new customer will make an advance payment.

Predictions are made on the test set.

**Model Evaluation**

The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using key metrics:

âœ… Accuracy Score â€“ Measures the percentage of correct predictions.

âœ… Classification Report â€“ Shows precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

âœ… Confusion Matrix â€“ Displays the number of correct vs. incorrect predictions.

âœ… ROC-AUC Score â€“ Measures how well the model differentiates between payers and non-payers.

**Business Insights & Recommendations**

ðŸ“Œ Key Findings from the Model:

Customers with higher incomes, better credit scores, and past advance payments are more likely to make advance payments.

Self-employed customers are slightly less likely to make advance payments compared to employed ones.

Higher interest rates discourage advance payments.

ðŸ“Œ Business Strategies to Increase Advance Payments:

âœ… Offer Discounts on Interest Rates â€“ Encourage early payments by reducing interest rates for likely payers.

âœ… Custom Loan Plans â€“ Provide flexible early repayment options for high-credit-score customers.

âœ… Loyalty Rewards for Repeat Payers â€“ Incentivize customers with a history of advance payments.

âœ… Targeted Marketing Campaigns â€“ Focus on high-income and high-credit-score customers.
